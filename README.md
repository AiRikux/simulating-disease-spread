# Simulating_Disease_Spread

Simulating Spread of Disease

This assignment was created for the subject Algorithms and Programming Foundations in Python during my first year in Monash University

Task 1 was to simulate how people are connected to one another. We were given a list of names with their connections or friends, this is given in the file a2_sample_set.txt .

Task 2 is running the simulation on how the virus can spread and resulted in the list of people that are contagious.

Task 3 was to visualise the number of disease spread and show how quickly it is spreading.

I learned to work with relational nodes in this task and the efficiency of connecting multiple files.
